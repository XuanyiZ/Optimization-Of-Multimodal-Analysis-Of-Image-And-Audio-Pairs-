# Optimization-Of-Multimodal-Analysis-Of-Image-And-Audio-Pairs-
Explored the learning ability of neural nets for Image And Audio Pairs Matching. 
<br></br>
Research about neural nets discovering word-like acoustic units from continuous speech at the waveform level with no additional text transcriptions or conventional speech recognition apparatus and grounding them to semantically relevant image regions.
